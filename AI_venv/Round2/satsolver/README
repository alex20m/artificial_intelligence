To run the SAT solver you need
  Python 3.x
  PLY, which is a parser/lexer tool for Python
  PySMT with the MathSAT solver installed

To install these in some Linux variants (e.g. Ubuntu Linux), write:

  sudo apt-get install python3 python3-ply
  pip install pysmt
  pysmt-install --msat

Call the solver with a command line of the form

  python3 solver.py INPUT.SPEC

where the file INPUT.SPEC contains a formula in the propositional logic.

See the sample files *.SPEC for syntax.

The atomic propositions must be declared with the 'variables' keyword.
The rest of the file contains one or more formulas, each ending in
a semicolon, and they are implicitly joined together with
the conjunction connective.

The solver parses the file and gives it to the MathSAT solver, which
determines if the variables can be given truth-values so that
the formula is TRUE. If one or more such satisfying assignments exists,
one of them is output. If none exists, the solver will say so.

The syntax supports the following connectives:
   not         negation
   and, &      conjunction
   or, |       disjunction
   xor         exclusive or
   ->, impl    implication
   <->, eqvi   equivalence

WARNING: The parser error handling is simplistic, and the error
messages you might get for syntactically malformed input are
not very informative.
Make sure you declare all propositional variables with the
'variables' keyword. If you don't, you will see syntax error
messages that don't indicate the cause of the error in any way.
